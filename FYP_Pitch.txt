Pitch
Problem 1:
Imagine a student cheating during an online exam by using phones, notes or someone else helping him. This makes the test unfair since teachers can’t monitor him.

Problem 2:
Also during physical exam, single teacher cannot monitor every student at the same time, so cheating using hidden notes or phones can easily happen. The failure to monitor means teachers have no clear evidence to prove who has cheated. 

Solution: 
Our solution is an AI system that acts as a smart invigilator for both online and physical exams. It uses cameras, voice recognition and screen tools to catch all suspicious actions, automatically saving the evidence so teachers can fully trust the final grades. This system uses front and back camera to monitor the student in online exam and a single front camera to monitor in physical exam.
